# Ensemblux pipeline overview
The Ensemblux pipeline was designed to facilitate the application of Ensemblux for demultiplexing real-world pools. We provide two distinct, yet highly comparable pipelines intended for demultiplexing either with or without prior genotype information. Specifically, the pipelines comprises of four distinct steps each :

1. Selection of Ensemblux pipeline and establishing the working directory (Set up)
2. Prepare input files for constituent genetic demultiplexing tools
3. Genetic demultiplexing by constituent demultiplexing tools
4. Application of the Ensemblux framework

Each step of the pipeline is comprehensively described in the proceeding sections of the Ensemblux documentation.
